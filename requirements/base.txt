# Allow Django to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

# About psycopg2-binary vs. psycopg2:
# psycopg2 separates source and binary releases into separate packages
# (psycopg2 and psycopg2-binary respectively) starting from 2.7, with the
# intention of emphasizing that they consider the binary unsafe for production.
# This decision was from a threading-related segfault issue, although not an
# easily replicated one:
# https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/543
# And it appears they may have fixed the issue, but are playing it safe until
# someone who can replicate the issue can confirm it's fixed:
# https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2-wheels/pull/8/files
# All things considered, we'll use the binary in all environments for
# simplicity of installation. However, if we encounter any segfaults
# in huey workers, we should revisit this.
#
# About psycopg 2 versus 3:
# Django <=4.1 doesn't support 3, but support is planned in Django 4.2.
